# Open positions


<!-- We are always looking for new group members with passion, talent, and grit! You will have the chance to work on the grand challenges of condensed matter physics, often at the interface of instrumental design and new physics. You will be involved in determining the important and interesting questions, creating and improving instrumental setups, performing measurements, and making discoveries. -->

### Current open positions
We currently don't have funding for additional PhD students. We can only welcome **exchange studnets**.


<!-- We are looking for Postdoc or research assistant who has a background in UAV/robotics/control/planning. If you are interested in working with us, please send me an email and briefly state what you are interested and attach a CV. -->

<!-- ### Applications for PhD and Postdoc positions
If you are interested in working with us as a PhD student or postdoc, please send me an [email](mailto:milan.allan@gmail.com). State briefly why you are interested and attach a CV, including information about the grades you had as an undergraduate. No need for a separate cover letter or certificates. **Important**: please insert _"Application PhD"_ or _"Application Postdoc"_ in the subject line.

### MSc projects for PolyU students

<!-- ### Bsc / Master students from elsewhere
If you are interested in pursuing a Master degree at Leiden University, see [mastersinleiden.nl](http://www.mastersinleiden.nl/programmes/physics/en/introduction). Sometimes, we take master students or summer interns if we get exceptional applicants (this usually means very good grades and a personal recommendation). -->
