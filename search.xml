    <content type="text"><![CDATA[This is the first time I arrive the South Planet. For the first trip, I visited Gold Coast and Brisbane in Queensland, Australia. Brisbane is the third largest city in Australia with a beautiful river. The city is not large compared with Asia cities. As my wife is working in a small town called Dalby which is about 200 km to the west of Brisbane. After my flight touch down at Gold Coast airport, I got my rented car and directly drive to Dalby. I takes me about 2.5 hour to arrive there. The high speed road in Australia is quite good with speed limit of 100 km/s. I stayed at Dalby for one night and then drive to Brisbane with Vera. Brisbane is a quite nice city for me. It is not too crowed but has all the necessary service of a medium city. After stayed at Brisbane for 2 night, we headed to Gold Coast, which is another beautiful city quite near to Brisbane. Gold Coast really has a long coast with fine sands. Vera’s birthday was celebrated at a Italian restaurant. The menu was quite hard to understand for us, so we just ordered some common food such as spaghetti and pizza. We stayed at a hostal near to the airport. Most of the roommates seems to be surfing lovers. I went back to Hong Kong the second day and Vera also went back to Dably can continue to work after a 4 days holiday.]]></content>

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[We have developed a fixed-wing UAV system to take part in the Search and Rescure category of Taiwan UAV competition. The video is a good summary for this work and the competition. If you want to get more information, you can continue to read. System ConfigurationThe basic airfram of this UAV system is a commercial EPO model called Talon. We added many subsystems to the UAV platform to enable the autonomous targets search. The airspeed sensor is mounted on a pretty 3D-printing sit. The Automatic Antana Tracker(AAT) is used to extent the communication range of the 433MHz temelemtry system. This figure shows the navigation turning results in Yuan Lung test site. We mounted two camaras on the UAV. The main camera is the GoPro with two-axis gimbal.

    <title><![CDATA[Dancing Robot]]></title>
    <url>%2F2011%2F03%2F04%2FDancing-Robot%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[The goal of the competition is to build a robot which can dance with music. The music is pre-prepared so the actions of the robot is fixed. This is the second project I was involved after the smart racing car. Similar to all the robotic system, the development of dancing robots also including three parts, which are mechanical design, electronic design, and finally software design. The mechanical design part provide every team a chance to define their own dancing robot. The idea of our team came from a member Qi. He would like to design a robot which could be transformed between a hand shape and a dog shape. The robot in the hand shape is shown hereHand: The robot in the dog shape is shown here Dog: Besides to the mechanical design, we also need to design the PCB board for the system. Luckily, as our team has participated in this competition for many years, we have quite stable PCB board to power and drive up to 24 servos. But at that time, all the servos we used are analog servos which are not precise enough for some high challenge motions. To upgrade to digital servos, all the PCB and software should be upgraded. For this time of competition, we did not make such large upgrade. All the upgrade was made one year later. Besides to dancing robot, our team also participated into search and rescue robot competition. It is still a quite challenge mission at the year of 2011. The ground robot will enter an unknown environment and conduct SLAM mission. Although the vehicle could be operated remotely by WiFi network, it still need to finish some quite hard tasks such as clime stairs. After nearly a week of competition, we have won many prizes in both dancing and search/rescue robot group. This is my first time to take part in a national competition and I found it quite challenge but interesting. I need to finish regular courses and homework on time, and still need to spent extra time on these competitions. But the hand-on work like this really arouse my interests as an engineering student. These competitions provide us with good opportunity to build some real machines which may help to solve some practical problems in the future.]]></content>
