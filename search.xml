    <content><![CDATA[<p>The flapping-wing micro air vehicle is my project during the master’s study. Our research group in NPU built different kinds for small flying vehicles including flapping-wing and fixed-wing MAV. The flapping-wing MAV is our focused topic for more than 10 years. Here is a video to introduce our flapping-wing MAV.</p>

    <title>Dancing Robot</title>
    <url>/2011/03/04/Dancing-Robot/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>The goal of the competition is to build a robot which can dance with music. The robot has a self-designed mechanical structure driven by digital servos. The music is pre-prepared so the actions of the robot is fixed. This is the second project I was involved after the smart racing car competition. Similar to all the robotic system, the development of dancing robots includes three parts, which are mechanical design, electronic design, and finally software design. The mechanical design part provide every team a chance to define their own dancing robot. The idea of our team came from a member Qi. He would like to design a robot which could be transformed between a hand shape and a dog shape.</p>
<p>The robot in the hand shape is:<br><img src="/images/robot2.jpg" alt="hand"></p>
<p>The robot in the dog shape is:<br><img src="/images/robot3.jpg" alt="Dog"></p>
<a id="more"></a>

<p>Besides to the mechanical design, we also need to design the PCB board for the system. Luckily, as our team has participated in this competition for many years, we have quite stable PCB board to power and drive up to 24 servos. But at that time, all the servos we used are analog servos which are not precise enough for some high challenge motions. To upgrade to digital servos, all the PCB and software should be upgraded. For this time of competition, we did not make such large upgrade. All the upgrade was made one year later.</p>
<p>Our team also participated into search and rescue robot competition. It is still a quite challenge mission at the year of 2011. The ground robot will enter an unknown environment and conduct SLAM mission. Although the vehicle could be operated remotely by WiFi network, it still need to finish some quite hard tasks such as clime stairs.</p>
<p><img src="/images/robot4.jpg" alt="tank"></p>
<p>After nearly a week of competition, we have won many prizes in both dancing and search/rescue robot group. This is my first time to take part in a national competition and I found it quite challenge but interesting. I need to finish regular courses and homework on time, and still need to spent extra time on these competitions. But the hand-on work like this really arouse my interests as an engineering student. These competitions provide us with good opportunity to build some real machines which may help to solve some practical problems in the future.</p>

    <title>Freescale Smart Car Racing Competition</title>
    <url>/2010/03/04/Smart-Car/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>The goal of this competition is to build model racing car prototype which could follow the black curve on the ground detected by visual sensor. Each team is made up of three members. The other two members of our team include two third-year undergraduate student majored in automation and mathematics. An example of the route during the competition is shown here.<br><img src="/images/route.jpg" alt="Route"></p>
<a id="more"></a>

<p>My task is mainly focused on the PCB design. My design is a two-layer PCB with a Freescale MCU. This is the first time I participated in an engineering project out of the normal courses. I learned the PCB design software Protel which is an old version of Altium designer.<br><img src="/images/pcb.jpg" alt="PCB"></p>
<p>We used a CCD camera in the heading of our car to detect the route. The real-time images were processed by the MCU and the commands were calculated by the control loop and then send to motor for speed control and servo for steer control.<br><img src="/images/car1.jpg" alt="Our car"></p>
<p>Although finally we did not achieve good performance of the national competition, I really got a lot of engineering experience during this project, which also opened a small door for me to the robotic world.<br><img src="/images/car3.jpg" alt="Our car2"></p>

    <title>UAV Communication Relay System</title>
    <url>/2016/03/04/UAV-Communication-Relay-System/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>In the development of beyond-line-of-sight (BLOS) Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) systems, communication between the UAVs and the ground control station (GCS) is of critical importance. The commonly used economical wireless modules are restricted by the short communication range and are easily blocked by obstacles. The use of a communication relay system provides a practical way to solve these problems, improving the performance of UAV communication in BLOS and cross-obstacle operations. In this study, a communication relay system, in which a quadrotor was used to relay radio communication for another quadrotor was developed and tested. First, the UAVs used as the airborne platform were constructed, and the hardware for the communication relay system was selected and built up. Second, a set of software programs and protocol for autonomous mission control, communication relay control, and ground control were developed. Finally, the system was fully integrated into the airborne platform and tested both indoor and in-flight. The Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) and noise value in two typical application scenarios were recorded. The test results demonstrated the ability of this system to extend the communication range and build communication over obstacles. This system also shows the feasibility to coordinate multiple UAVs’ communication with the same relay structure.<br><img src="/images/momson.png" width = "800" height = "300" alt="title" align=center /></p>

    <title>Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) Tail-Sitter UAV</title>
    <url>/2018/10/14/VTOL-Tailsitter/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>This is the main topic for my <a href="http://ira.lib.polyu.edu.hk/handle/10397/80315" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PhD thesis</a>. The aim of this project is to design and optimize a VTOL tail-sitter UAV. The main work can be divided into design, model and control parts.</p>

<h2 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h2><p>Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are playing more and more important roles in current society. They can not only be used for entertainment, but also execute missions such as surveillance, cargo delivery, geographic survey, etc. Tail-sitter UAV, one of the configurations that can vertically take off and land (VTOL), is a promising high efficient UAV configuration that can be adopted in high-density urban areas. The main object of this thesis is to improve the hovering and transition performance of tail-sitter UAV system, by studying the key technologies including modeling, model predictive control, and optimal transition trajectory. First of all, the quad-rotor tail-sitter UAV prototype ‘PolyU Plus Tail-sitter’ (PPT) is designed and built according to the requirement of urban cargo delivery missions. The ‘plus’ flying-wing configuration is selected due to the structural simplicity, high aerodynamic efficiency, and actuator reliability. Digital model of the UAV is built up for control simulation and performance analysis. The developed simulation model can reflect the main dynamic characteristics of the UAV and is able to be used as real-time simulation platform. Then, the cascaded two-loop model predictive controller (MPC) for hover flight is developed based on linearized state-space model. The measured and unmeasured disturbance are introduced into the augmented dynamic model to improve the tracking and disturbance rejection performance. The controllers are tuned and verified in the hardware-in-loop (HIL) simulation environment and then implemented to an onboard flight computer for real-time execution in the indoor VICON environment. The simulation and experimental results indicates that the proposed MPC controller has good tracking and position holding capability against disturbance such as prevailing and gusty winds. Finally, both the forward and back transition trajectories are optimized according to the minimized energy costs. The simplified 3-DOF longitudinal model is used as the dynamic constraint. The transition optimization problem is transcript into a non-linear programming (NLP) problem and solved by collocation methods. Simulation with Gazebo simulator and outdoor flight experiments are carried out with the optimized transition trajectories. The simulation and experimental results show that the optimized transition strategy enable both the forward and back transitions with less time, less height change, and energy consumption compared with traditional linear transition method.</p>
