They can not only be used for entertainment, but also execute missions such as surveillance, cargo delivery, geographic survey, etc. Tail-sitter UAV, one of the configurations that can vertically take off and land (VTOL), is a promising high efficient UAV configuration that can be adopted in high-density urban areas. The main object of this thesis is to improve the hovering and transition performance of tail-sitter UAV system, by studying the key technologies including modeling, model predictive control, and optimal transition trajectory. First of all, the quad-rotor tail-sitter UAV prototype ‘PolyU Plus Tail-sitter’ (PPT) is designed and built according to the requirement of urban cargo delivery missions. The ‘plus’ flying-wing configuration is selected due to the structural simplicity, high aerodynamic efficiency, and actuator reliability. Digital model of the UAV is built up for control simulation and performance analysis. The developed simulation model can reflect the main dynamic characteristics of the UAV and is able to be used as real-time simulation platform. Then, the cascaded two-loop model predictive controller (MPC) for hover flight is developed based on linearized state-space model. The measured and unmeasured disturbance are introduced into the augmented dynamic model to improve the tracking and disturbance rejection performance. The controllers are tuned and verified in the hardware-in-loop (HIL) simulation environment and then implemented to an onboard flight computer for real-time execution in the indoor VICON environment. The simulation and experimental results indicates that the proposed MPC controller has good tracking and position holding capability against disturbance such as prevailing and gusty winds. Finally, both the forward and back transition trajectories are optimized according to the minimized energy costs. The simplified 3-DOF longitudinal model is used as the dynamic constraint. The transition optimization problem is transcript into a non-linear programming (NLP) problem and solved by collocation methods. Simulation with Gazebo simulator and outdoor flight experiments are carried out with the optimized transition trajectories. The simulation and experimental results show that the optimized transition strategy enable both the forward and back transitions with less time, less height change, and energy consumption compared with traditional linear transition method.</p><h2 id="Video"><a href="#Video" class="headerlink" title="Video"></a>Video</h2><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kYevywwGgjQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The goal of the competition is to build a robot which can dance with music. </p><a id="more"></a><p>The music is pre-prepared so the actions of the robot is fixed. This is the second project I was involved after the smart racing car. Similar to all the robotic system, the development of dancing robots also including three parts, which are mechanical design, electronic design, and finally software design. The mechanical design part provide every team a chance to define their own dancing robot. The idea of our team came from a member Qi. He would like to design a robot which could be transformed between a hand shape and a dog shape. </p><p>The robot in the hand shape is shown here<br>Hand:<br><img src="/images/robot2.jpg" alt="hand"></p><p>The robot in the dog shape is shown here<br> Dog:<br><img src="/images/robot3.jpg" alt="Dog"></p><p>Besides to the mechanical design, we also need to design the PCB board for the system. Luckily, as our team has participated in this competition for many years, we have quite stable PCB board to power and drive up to 24 servos. But at that time, all the servos we used are analog servos which are not precise enough for some high challenge motions. To upgrade to digital servos, all the PCB and software should be upgraded. For this time of competition, we did not make such large upgrade. All the upgrade was made one year later.</p><p>Besides to dancing robot, our team also participated into search and rescue robot competition. It is still a quite challenge mission at the year of 2011. The ground robot will enter an unknown environment and conduct SLAM mission. Although the vehicle could be operated remotely by WiFi network, it still need to finish some quite hard tasks such as clime stairs. </p><p><img src="/images/robot4.jpg" alt="tank"></p><p>After nearly a week of competition, we have won many prizes in both dancing and search/rescue robot group. This is my first time to take part in a national competition and I found it quite challenge but interesting. I need to finish regular courses and homework on time, and still need to spent extra time on these competitions. But the hand-on work like this really arouse my interests as an engineering student. These competitions provide us with good opportunity to build some real machines which may help to solve some practical problems in the future.<br><img src="/images/dance1.jpg" alt="Team"></p>]]></content>
